## What exactly is an Afficone payout?

We do have automated payouts, but they don't really include the actual transaction to the affiliate. Here's how it works:

Based on your payout schedule and minimum balance threshold, our system will generate a payout for all affiliates that have unpaid balance.

Now that you have unpaid payouts, all that's left to do on your side is **actually pay out** them out. Afficone payouts are only transaction templates, made to speed up the paying process.

<Tip>
We don't act as a middleman or take a part in the actual transactions, that's on your part.

<Note>
You can also mark many payouts as paid, depending on the payout method. This way you don't have to individually mark each payout as paid.
