<Note>
    If you prefer, you can also create use a custom integration by [using our API](/api-reference/authentication).
</Note>

Each affiliate portal has an unique prefix that's used for the portal subdomain.
> For example: `yourwebsite.afficone.com`

If you have the **Startup plan or higher**, you can use a custom domain from the [Portal settings](https://afficone.com/dashboard/website).

## Commission types

After creating your portal, you should go ahead and set the default commission rates for your affiliates. This can be done in the [Commission settings](https://afficone.com/dashboard/website).
