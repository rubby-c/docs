## Syncing your products to Afficone

You can set individual commission rates for your different products.

<Note>
For example, affiliates can receive 15% commission from selling **Product A** and 20% from selling **Product B**.
</Note>

We use the first available rate in this order:
- Product-specific rates (if set)
- Affiliate group rates (if set)
- Individual affiliate rates

Note: We don't automatically sync newly created products.

## Adding a product manually

If you wish, you can also add a product manually. All you have to do is specify the internal ID, product name and your desired commission rates.

<Warning>
Make sure that the product id matches your product id internally. We check every order that's received on our end and try to find a product with a matching id.
