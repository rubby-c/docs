## Linking your custom domain

You can [link your domain](https://afficone.com/dashboard/website) by adding a CNAME DNS record to your domain DNS configuration.

It has to point to your affiliate portal's URL (which is usually `[prefix].afficone.com`).

Once you've added the DNS record, press on the **Announce** button and wait a little till your DNS records are updated. When that's done, click on **Check Validity and Apply** to start using your subdomain.

## Linking your SMTP server

You can also [link your own SMTP server](https://afficone.com/dashboard/emails) in order to use your domain for affiliate emails.

<Warning>
If you're using Gmail, make sure to use an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) instead of your password. This requires 2 factor authentication.
