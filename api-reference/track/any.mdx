This endpoint **isn't recommended**, but we're leaving it as an option.

<Warning>
    With this endpoint, we can only match the referral by the coupons you have set in the `coupons` property. If you want a more reliable experience, you should use the [other endpoint](/api-reference/track/code) instead.
