After signing up and selecting Stripe as your payment provider, you need to do a few things before you can start using Afficone.

1. ## Connect your Stripe Account

After signing up selecting Stripe as your payment provider, click the Connect with Stripe button. This will lead you to a Stripe-hosted page where you can select the Stripe Account you want to use for this integration.

<Note>In order to track your orders and subscriptions as well as handle refunds, Afficone will receive a few [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) when something happens on your Stripe account. More specifically [charge.refunded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.refunded), [invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid) and [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed).</Note>

2. ## Install our tracking script on your website

In order to track affiliate clicks, you have to add our **&lt;script&gt;** tag to all of your website's pages.

> For example, if you have a landing page at **example.com**, but your billing page is at **app.example.com**, you have to add the script to both of these pages.

3. ## Integrate your Stripe's payment system

Depending on how you handle payments on your side, you might have to add some additional code on your backend.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Client Checkout">
        If you're using client-based Stripe checkouts, you have to add the `clientReferenceId` property to your checkout configuration.

        ```javascript
        <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>

        stripe.redirectToCheckout({
            success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
            mode: 'payment' | 'setup' | 'subscription',
            line_items: [
                // The items being purchased
            ],
            clientReferenceId: window.Afficone.referral ?? null
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Server Checkout">
        On the client, the affiliate's coupon code is stored in the `window.Afficone.referral` property.

        ```javascript
        const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_API_KEY');

        const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
            success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
            mode: 'payment' | 'setup' | 'subscription',
            line_items: [
                // The items being purchased
            ],
            customer_creation: "always" // Required to be "always"
            clientReferenceId: "[AFFILIATE_COUPON]" // Pass this from the browser
        });

        const url = session.url;
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Payment Links">
        When creating a payment link, make sure to check **Save payment details for future use**.
        <Note>If you're creating it via API, set `customer_creation: "always"`</Note>

        ![Payment Links setup](/images/integrations/stripe/payment-links-setup.png)

        The Afficone SDK will automatically insert the `client_reference_id` parameter in all `<a>` elements containing a payment link.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Buy Buttons">
        When creating a buy button, make sure to check **Save payment details for future use**.
        <Note>If you're creating it via API, set `customer_creation: "always"`</Note>

        ![Payment Links setup](/images/integrations/stripe/payment-links-setup.png)

        The Afficone SDK will automatically insert the `client_reference_id` parameter in all `<stripe-buy-button>` elements.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Offering free trials?

If you're creating Stripe customers via API (that's usually the case when offering a free trial), you have to set some customer metadata manually.

This is done by specifying an `_afficoneRef` property in the metadata object when creating a customer:

```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')('[Your API key]');

const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
   metadata: {
       _afficoneRef: '[Referral Code]',
   }
});
```

<Tip>
You can pass the referral code from the browser to your backend - it's located in `window.Afficone.referral`.
