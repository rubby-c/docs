After signing up and selecting Paddle as your payment provider, you need to do a few things before you can start using Afficone.

1. ## Install our tracking script on your website

In order to track affiliate clicks, you have to add our **&lt;script&gt;** tag to all of your website's pages.

> For example, if you have a landing page at **example.com**, but your billing page is at **app.example.com**, you have to add the script to both of these pages.

2. ## Create a Paddle webhook

Afficone needs to use a Paddle webhook to track your sales, subscriptions and refunds.

<Tip>
    You can find this menu in **Developer Tools** > **Notifications** > **New Destination**.
</Tip>

The webhook URL has to be `https://api.afficone.com/hooks/paddle/[Your-Portal-Token]`. You'll receive a unique portal token once you sign up and choose your payment provider.

<Note>
    Make sure to check the following events:
    - **transaction.completed**
    - **adjustment.created**
    - **adjustment.updated**
</Note>

Once you're done, pass the webhook secret to our setup so we can that verify webhooks are really coming from your Paddle account.

<Note>
    Our tracking script handles all Paddle integrations for you. Just make sure it's placed on all your important pages, including landing page.

    You can pass `window.Afficone.referral` from your frontend to backend and attach a custom data property (it has to be named `_afficoneRef`) containing the referral code.

    ```javascript
    {   
        //...
        "custom_data": {
            "_afficoneRef": "(value)"
        }
    }
    ```
