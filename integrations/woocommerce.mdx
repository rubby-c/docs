After signing up and selecting WooCommerce as your payment provider, you need to do a few things before you can start using Afficone.

1. ## Install our tracking plugin on your website

    Current version: 1.3.3
</Card>

In order to track and attribute orders properly, you'll need to install the Afficone plugin to your 
WordPress website. You can do that by:

1. Going to **Plugins â†’ Add New Plugin**.
2. Press the **Upload Plugin** button on the top.
3. Select the plugin `.zip` file and hit **Install Now**.

After installing it, you should make sure there isn't a compatibility error.

2. ## Make sure you don't have any conflicting plugins

It's pretty common for WordPress sites to have plugins that optimize static files like images and javascript scripts. This can cause the Afficone tracking script to not work as intended.

        Also, if you're using the **Delay JavaScript execution** feature, make sure to exclude our script.
