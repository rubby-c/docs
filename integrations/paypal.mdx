<Warning>
For this integration, you need a [PayPal business](https://www.paypal.com/en/business) account!
</Warning>

1. ## Create a PayPal developer app

Head to [PayPal Developers](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/live) and create an app (the name doesn't matter).

<Note>
    After creating the app, make sure to check the following permissions:
    - **Payouts**
    - **Customer disputes**
    - **Transaction search**
</Note>

2. ## Find your app's client Id and secret

Afficone needs these to access to attribute your new sales to the appropriate affilites.

3. ## Attach the referral code to your PayPal button

Since we can't do that automatically, you'll have to edit some of your website's code.

```javascript
paypal.Buttons({
    // ... other properties
    createOrder: function (data, actions) {
        return actions.order.create({
            // ... other properties
            purchase_units: [{
                // ... other properties
                custom_id: window.Afficone.referral
            }]
        });
    },
}).render("#YOUR-PAYPAL-BUTTON-ID");
```

If you're using a plugin or not using PayPal buttons, you can search for the equivalent of `custom_id` for your type of integration.

<Note>
PayPal's developer documentation is kind of a mess. They have a bunch of ways you can pay somebody, that are completely incompatible with eachother.

The most common way is [PayPal buttons](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/reference/#link-paypalbuttonsoptions) (that's what we support).

If you use something else, you can contact us at contact@afficone.com and we could try to include it in our PayPal integration and this documentation.
