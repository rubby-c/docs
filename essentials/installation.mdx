In order for us to track visits (clicks) referred by your affiliates, you'll need to add our script to your website.

> Depending on your payment processor, you can either manually add it or install a plugin (e.g. WordPress).

If you're reading this page, chances are, you're going for a custom integration.

Add the Afficone script to your page and make sure to replace **[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]** with your portal token:

```html
<script async src="https://afficone.com/scripts/sdk.js?token=[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]" />
```

> ðŸ“˜ Script size
> 
> For the web devs out there, don't worry, it's less than **3 KB** :)

**That's all!** We will additionally track referrers, locations & more information about your customers so your affiliates (and you) can have full insight into their audience.
