## Adding the tracking script to your website

In order for us to track visits (clicks) referred by your affiliates, you'll need to add our script to your website.

<Note>Depending on your payment processor, you can either manually inject it or install a plugin that does it for you (for example, our WooCommerce plugin).</Note>

If you're reading this, chances are, you're going for a custom integration. Add the Afficone script to your page and make sure to replace `[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]` with your portal's token:

```html
<script async src="https://afficone.com/scripts/sdk.js?token=[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]" />
```

**That's all!** We will additionally track referrers, locations & more information about your customers so your affiliates can have full insight into their audience.

## Troubleshooting

A good way to check if everything went smooth is opening Chrome Developer Tools and searching for your portal's token.

<Tip>You can open Chrome Developer Tools with `CTRL + SHIFT + I`</Tip>

If everything is working as intended, the `<script>` tag should look like this:

```html
<script src="https://afficone.com/scripts/sdk.js?token=5102002150667984" [..any other attributes]></script>
```

or possibly like this:

```html
<link rel="preload" src="https://afficone.com/scripts/sdk.js?token=5617765752175647" as="script">
```

<Note>
What's important is that the script URL stays intact with the token being at the end of it.
</Note>

Another way to check is by opening your browser console and typing `window.Afficone.affiData`. This should show you information about your portal.

<Warning>
    Please note that you have to make sure the script is on **all of your important pages**. If you have it on your landing page, but not on your billing page, we will not be able to track orders for some integrations.
