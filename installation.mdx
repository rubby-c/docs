## Adding a script tag to your website

In order for us to track visits (clicks) referred by your affiliates, you'll need to add our script to your website.

> Depending on your payment processor, you can either manually add it or install a plugin (e.g. WordPress).

If you're reading this, chances are, you're going for a custom integration. Add the Afficone script to your page and make sure to replace `[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]` with your portal's token:

```html
<script async src="https://afficone.com/scripts/sdk.js?token=[YOUR_SITE_TOKEN]" />
```

**That's all!** We will additionally track referrers, locations & more information about your customers so your affiliates can have full insight into their audience.

## Troubleshooting

A good way to check if everything went smooth is opening Chrome Developer Tools and searching for your portal's token.

> You can open Chrome Developer Tools with `CTRL + SHIFT + I`

If everything's working, the script tag should look like this:

![](/images/installation/html-check-footer.png)

or possibly like this:

![](/images/installation/html-check.png)

What's important is that the script URL stays intact with the token being at the end of it.

> Please note that you have to make sure the script is on **all of your important pages**. If you have it on your landing page, but not on your billing page, we will not be able to track orders for some integrations.
